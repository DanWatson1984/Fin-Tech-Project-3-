Real Estate transfer and registration using smart contracts and block chain. 

Why ? Real estate markets and the title industry in general have largly been untouched by new technologies. They continue to operate with inefficent processes and old technologies that open them up to errors. 

The act of buying and transferring ownership of the property remains a tedious and lengthy process. These transfers typically need to be reviewed and confirmed by an array of intermediaries including agents, lawyers, and governmental bodies, just to name a few. By applying blockchain and smart contract technology, the process can be simplified, thus saving time and money for both the buyer and the seller.

WHAT WE LEARNED: 
Right now the system to transfer the title to your property involves executing a sales contract between buyer and seller, sending that contract to a title company or attorney, having a title search run and reviewed by the title company or attorney, going to closing ie buyer brings the funds for purchase the home and the seller signs over a deed to the property, and then finally having the new deed is approved and registered with the local land records to show the transfer of ownership. 

We were able in a very short tile show that this process can be handled almost exclusivly via a smart contract and block chain. We minted a token for the property and joined the buyer, seller, lender, and local registry under one smart contract that allowed for the transfering of the property. 

The implications on the title industry in general are interesting. If properties were transfered via blockchain it would eliminate human errors in the chain of title such as indexing errors, name errors and legal description errors, etc because the technology does not allow for these issues. It woudld also eliminate almost all chances of fraud because you would no longer be relying on humans to verify identities. This all translates to less risk of title insurance underwirters and would therefore equate to lower costs for the consumers. 

DOWNSIDE/ISSUES
After completling this project there are a few issues that I think could slow this from being implimented. 
1. Confusion. It is much less "readable" for the average person. People would need to be educated on the terms and functions before they would change to this. 
2. Cost. Right now the tech costs for companies and local governments is extremely low and implimenting a smart contract/blockchain system would be cost prohibitive.
