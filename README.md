Real Estate transfer and registration using smart contracts and block chain. 

Why ? Real estate markets and the title industry in general have largly been untouched by new technologies. They continue to operate with inefficent processes and old technologies that open them up to errors. 

The act of buying and transferring ownership of the property remains a tedious and lengthy process. These transfers typically need to be reviewed and confirmed by an array of intermediaries including agents, lawyers, and governmental bodies, just to name a few. By applying blockchain and smart contract technology, the process can be simplified, thus saving time and money for both the buyer and the seller.

WHAT WE LEARNED: 
Right now the system to transfer the title to your property involves executing a sales contract between buyer and seller, sending that contract to a title company or attorney, having a title search run and reviewed by the title company or attorney, going to closing ie buyer brings the funds for purchase the home and the seller signs over a deed to the property, and then finally having the new deed is approved and registered with the local land records to show the transfer of ownership. 

We were able in a very short tile show that this process can be handled almost exclusivly via a smart contract and block chain.
